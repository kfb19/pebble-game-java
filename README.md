## Introduction

This program implements the Huffman Coding compression algorithm in order to reduce the size of a text file. It is written in Java and allows the user to choose what file to compress, as well as working out the percentage reduction in size of the file. 

## Prerequisites

Developed in Java *version here*

the user needs to have

The user also needs the correct version of Java installed. 

## Installation

There is no prior instillation required for this program, other than the correct version of Java and the JVM. 

## Getting Started 

Use command line to call the Java compiler (from the directory src in huffman) to compile the program CompressionInterface.java. Then use the Java command to run it. Because the program deals with large files, you need to increase the stack size when running by using the flag -Xss515m. An example of this is below. Follow the instructions given to you in the command line once the program runs, and if the program crashes please restart it as this means you have entered an incorrect input. 

```bash
cd huffman\src
javac CompressionInterface.java
java -Xss515m CompressionInterface
```
