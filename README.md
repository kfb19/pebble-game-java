## Introduction

Pebble Game is a program written for a University of Exeter Software Development coursework. The game is played by 1+ players, and involves three white bags and three black bags. The black bags contain pebbles with weights assigned to them, and each black bag has a corresponding white bag. Each user initially picks out 10 pebbles, then as the game progresses, they discard a pebble into a white back and draw another pebble from the black bag. If a black bag empties at any point, the pebbles from the corresponding white bag will be empitied into the black bag. A player has won the game if the combined weights of the pebbles in their hand is exactky 100. Players carry on picking and discarding pebbles until someone has won.
